== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are those shortcodes? =
It is a bundled Wordpress feature. It looks like this : `[shortcode]sample value[/shortcode]`.
It looks like nothing but it is an expandable feature so we can plug our own shortcodes ... like with this widget.

= How can I use the shortcodes? =
You have 2 ways to using them:

 * by writing yourself the shortcode as plain text
 * by using the shortcode wizard provided with the Rich Text Editor (TinyMCE)

You can even insert them through the copy/paste feature.

= What is the copy/paste feature you talk about? =
It's easy : when you want to insert a widget through the RTE wizard, you have a copy/paste tab.
It's waiting you to copy/paste the Amazon's provided HTML.

It then auto-fills every single field needed.

That is smart. You save time, you gain in quality usage.

= Won't context links garbage my whole page? =
No it won't.

I added a filter so the context links areas are confined to post and page contents.
If politely asked, I can make this customizable from the plugin management page.

= Can I translate your plugin? =
Yes for sure but do it only if it's not already translated in your language.
For this, check Wordpress documentation about [translating a plugin](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin#Internationalizing_Your_Plugin) and [translating Wordpress](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress)

Once you have done your first translation from the trunk, [contact me](http://case.oncle-tom.net/contact).

= How is organized the translation =
There are 3 steps:

1. code freezing
2. translation
3. code release

The code freeze will ... freeze the code in the repository. It means there won't be any changes, except some small bug fixes which don't impact translating work.
All the translation team will be notified by email about the code change and will let 1 week to translate new chains.

Once all the translations are up, they are added in the repository and the new plugin released.

= Nespresso, what else? =
Yep, what else?

But no, George Clooney neither Nespresso are a feature of this plugin. Too bad!
